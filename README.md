**🧠 System Overview**
The system integrates three core subsystems:
Automatic Landing Gear System – uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect altitude and trigger servo motor movement.
Fire Detection and Safety Signal System – activates alerts when fire is detected post-landing.
Radar-Based Aircraft Detection – uses optical sensing to simulate aircraft detection and proximity alerts.
Each module is powered and controlled via Arduino Uno, allowing for real-time automation testing and modular design flexibility.

**🔍 Results**
✅ Successful integration of all subsystems
✅ Accurate real-time detection and actuation
✅ Fast sensor response (<1 second latency)
✅ Clear LED and buzzer feedback
